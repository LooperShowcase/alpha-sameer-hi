        Netflix, Inc. is an American subscription streaming service and
        production company. Launched on August 29, 1997, it offers a library of
        films and television series through distribution deals as well as own
        production Netflix Originals. As of October 2021, Netflix has over 214
        million subscribers worldwide, including 74 million in the United States
        and Canada, 70 million in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, 39 million
        in Latin America, and 30 million in Asia-Pacific.[10][11] It is
        available worldwide except in mainland China (due to local
        restrictions), Syria, North Korea, and Crimea (due to US sanctions).
        Netflix has played a prominent role in independent film distribution,
        and is a member of the Motion Picture Association (MPA). Netflix can be
        accessed via internet browser on computers, or via application software
        installed on smart TVs, set-top boxes connected to televisions, tablet
        computers, smartphones, digital media players, Blu-ray Disc players,
        video game consoles, and virtual reality headsets on the list of
        Netflix-compatible devices.[12][13][14][15] It is available in 4K
        resolution.[16] In the United States, the company provides DVD and
        Blu-ray rentals delivered individually via the United States Postal
        Service from regional warehouses.[17] Netflix was founded in 1997 by
        Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph in Scotts Valley, California. Netflix
        initially both sold and rented DVDs by mail, but the sales were
        eliminated within a year to focus on the DVD rental business.[18][19] In
        2007, Netflix introduced streaming media and video on demand. The
        company expanded to Canada in 2010, followed by Latin America and the
        Caribbean. Netflix entered the content production industry in 2013,
        debuting its first series House of Cards. In January 2016, it expanded
        to an additional 130 countries and then operated in 190 countries. The
        company is ranked 164th on the Fortune 500[20] and 284th on the Forbes
        Global 2000.[21] It is the largest entertainment/media company by market
        capitalization.[22] In 2021, Netflix was ranked as the eighth most
        trusted brand globally by Morning Consult.[23] During the 2010s, Netflix
        was the top-performing stock in the S&P 500 stock market index, with a
        total return of 3,693%.[24][25] Netflix is headquartered in Los Gatos,
        California, in Santa Clara County,[26][27] with the two CEOs, Hastings
        and Ted Sarandos, split between Los Gatos and Los Angeles,
        respectively.[28][29] The company is seen as part of the Silicon Valley
        high-tech world.[30] It also operates international offices in Asia,
        Europe, and Latin America including in Canada, France, Brazil, the
        Netherlands, India, Japan, South Korea, and the United Kingdom. The
        company has production hubs in Los Angeles,[31] Albuquerque,[32]
        London,[33] Madrid, Vancouver and Toronto.[34] Compared to other
        distributors, Netflix pays more for TV shows up front, but keeps more
        upside on big hits.
