         Spider-Man: No Way Home is an upcoming American superhero
        film based on the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man co-produced by
        Columbia Pictures and Marvel Studios and distributed by Sony Pictures
        Releasing. It is the sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) and
        Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019), and the 27th film in the Marvel
        Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film is directed by Jon Watts, written by
        Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers, and stars Tom Holland as Peter Parker /
        Spider-Man alongside Zendaya, Benedict Cumberbatch, Jacob Batalon, Jon
        Favreau, Marisa Tomei, J. B. Smoove, Benedict Wong, Jamie Foxx, Alfred
        Molina, Willem Dafoe, Thomas Haden Church, and Rhys Ifans. In the film,
        Parker asks Dr. Stephen Strange (Cumberbatch) to help make his identity
        as Spider-Man a secret again with magic, which leads to the multiverse
        breaking open and allowing supervillains from alternate realities to
        enter Parker's universe. A third MCU Spider-Man film was planned as
        early as 2017, during production on Homecoming. By August 2019,
        negotiations between Sony and Marvel Studios to alter their deal—in
        which they produce the Spider-Man films together—ended with Marvel
        Studios leaving the project; however, a negative fan reaction led to a
        new deal between the two companies a month later. Watts, McKenna,
        Sommers, and Holland were set to return at that time. Filming began in
        October 2020 in New York City, before moving to Atlanta later that
        month. Several actors reprise characters from past Spider-Man film
        series, with the film exploring the concept of the multiverse. The title
        was revealed in February 2021, before filming wrapped at the end of
        March. Spider-Man: No Way Home will premiere in Los Angeles on December
        13, 2021, and is scheduled to be released in the United States on
        December 17, as part of Phase Four of the MCU.
